# 🍄 Mushroom Classification Project

This project explores binary classification of mushrooms as edible or poisonous using two supervised machine learning models: Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
It’s designed as a learning exercise in model training, evaluation, and comparison.

## Dataset

The dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository:
DOI: 10.24432/C5959T

It contains various categorical attributes of mushrooms and a target class indicating whether the mushroom is edible or poisonous.

## Models Used

**Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM**

Achieved an accuracy of 100% on the test data.

## Key Steps

- Data loading and preprocessing.
- Feature encoding.
- Model training and evaluation using scikit-learn.
- Comparison of model performance.
